# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

In this Challenge I create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Installation

No installation required.

## Usage

When the user open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When the user scroll down it will display a timeblocks for standard business hours.
When the user view the timeblocks for that day each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
When the user click into a timeblock he can enter an event.
When the user click the save button for that timeblock the text for that event is saved in local storage.
When the user refresh the page the saved events persist.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
